# Wagtail x GrapesJs

This is an integration of the amazing [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) and [GrapesJs](https://github.com/artf/grapesjs) to enable Visual page building. The visual page builder is intended to be used with wagtail and any python-based CMS.

The demo site [*bakerydemo*](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo) is designed to provide examples of common features and recipes to introduce you to Wagtail development. Beyond the code, it will also let you explore the admin / editorial interface of the CMS. Additinally, it also contains the necessary configurations required for the Visual page builder built with GrapesJs.
